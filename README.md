# WHOIS Domain Info Checker

## Project Description
This is a **Python-based WHOIS Domain Info Checker** designed for educational purposes.  
It allows users to enter a domain name and fetch information such as:

- Registrar  
- Creation Date  
- Expiration Date  
- Name Servers  

The results are displayed in the terminal and saved in both **TXT** and **CSV** files for future reference.

**Note:** Only use this script on domains you have permission to query. Some domains may have WHOIS protection enabled.

2. Install the required library in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install python-whois
3.Run the script:
python whois_checker.py

5.Check the generated files in your project folder:
-domain_info.txt
-domain_info.csv
